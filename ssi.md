In a world increasingly plagued by fraud, data breaches, and identity theft, self-sovereign identity offers an opportunity to promote data 
privacy by giving the Internet something it's never had before - a built-in identity layer.

Evernym is a consulting company that helped develop and standardize decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and launch the Sovrin Network, a public utility for self-sovereign identity.

Seth's writing provided insight into the opportunities associated with the application of self-sovereign identity in industries like 
[healthcare,](https://www.evernym.com/blog/claims-verification-healthcares-496b-problem/) [insurance,](https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-customer-experience-insurance/) and [finance](https://www.evernym.com/blog/six-ways-self-sovereign-identity-is-transforming-financial-services/).
